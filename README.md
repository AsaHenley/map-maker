This is a project I did using the d3.js library as the main tool for visualization and generation

I got the idea from Azgaar's fantasy map generator in which he uses the same library and generation methods I have in my code.
I started by closesly following a log he has found here, https://azgaar.wordpress.com/ , as a way for me to learn the d3.js libray as well as some generation techniques.

I have since added my own code and have plans to improve this project straying away from Azgaar's methods.
